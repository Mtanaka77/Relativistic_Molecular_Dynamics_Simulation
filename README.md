# molecular_dynamics
A molecular dynamics simulation code has been created for applications 
of relativistic and electromagnetic fields in three dimensions as 
for nanoscale phenomena. Maxwell equations are solved with Gauss's law
for necessary corrections. Each of relativistic particles are advanced in time. 

All explicit simulation code must satisfy the Courant condition, that is, 
Dx(length)/Dt(time step) > c, the speed of light. Simulations of a nanotube accelerator 
is discussed in the later half of CPC 2019 paper.
