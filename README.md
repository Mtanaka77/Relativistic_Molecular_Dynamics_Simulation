# molecular_dynamics
A molecular dynamics simulation code is created for applications 
of relativistic and electromagnetic fields in three dimensions as 
for nanoscale phenomena. Maxwell equations are solved where Gauss's law
must be solved for corrections, and each of particles are advanced in time. 

An explicit simulation code reqires the Courant condition, 
Dx(length)/Dt(time step) > c, the speed of light.
